# Hospital_Management_System
- (Tech stacks - Java, JDBC, MySql)
- For designing this project, I walk through creating tables for patients, doctors, appointments, and more, while establishing essential relationships and constraints.
- For establishing a seamless connection between Java and database I've used JDBC, a fundamental skill for any database-driven application.
- This project allows you to manage Patients, Doctors, Check doctor's availability & also book's appointment.
